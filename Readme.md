### Project Details
THis data is from the **Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)**, which provides annual records of **all fatal motor vehicle crashes in the U.S.**.
The data is available at the **state level** and includes information on the **number of fatalities**, **weather conditions**, and **other factors** related to each accident.

### **(1) Research Question**
**Does the 2019 increase in Utah’s allowable Alcohol by Volume (ABV) to 5% lead to an increase in traffic fatalities and crashes compared to other states?**  

---

### **(2) Why OLS Alone Would Be a Concern**
Using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression** without a causal identification strategy could lead to **biased estimates** because:
- **Omitted Variable Bias (OVB):** Other **unobserved factors** (e.g., road safety laws, economic trends, enforcement policies) may affect traffic fatalities.
- **Endogeneity:** States that changed ABV laws may have different pre-existing trends in alcohol consumption and traffic patterns compared to those that didn’t.
- **Simultaneity Bias:** Fatalities might influence alcohol laws rather than vice versa.

OLS alone would **not control for pre-existing trends** and **confounding variables**, making it difficult to establish a **causal relationship**.

---

### **(3) Strategy: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
To address these concerns, we will use a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** approach.  

**Why?**
- It allows us to compare **changes over time** in traffic fatalities in Utah relative to control states that did not change their ABV laws.
- This **removes confounding factors** that are constant over time (e.g., cultural attitudes toward drinking).
- It accounts for **pre-existing trends**, assuming that Utah and the control states followed parallel trends in traffic fatalities before the policy change.

### **(4) Data Description**
The data comes from the **Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)**, which provides annual records of **all fatal motor vehicle crashes in the U.S.**.  

#### **Key Variables:**
- **Outcome (Y):** `FATALS` (Number of fatalities per accident)
- **Treatment Variable:** `UTAH` (1 if Utah, 0 for control states)
- **Post-Treatment Indicator:** `POST` (1 for years 2019+, 0 before)
- **Interaction Term (DiD):** `UTAH × POST`
- **Controls:** `WEATHER`, `HARM_EV`, `DRUNK_DR` (DUI-related crashes)

### **(5) Level of Observation**
The **unit of observation** for our regression is **individual accident cases**, identified by `ST_CASE`, across multiple years (2016-2020).  

---

### **(6) Regression Equation and Code**
#### **Regression Equation (DiD Model)**
\[
FATALS_{ist} = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot UTAH_s + \beta_2 \cdot POST_t + \delta \cdot (UTAH_s \times POST_t) + X_{ist} \Gamma + \varepsilon_{ist}
\]
where:
- \( s \) indexes **states**
- \( t \) indexes **years**
- \( i \) indexes **accidents**
- \( X_{ist} \) includes **control variables** (e.g., weather, drunk driving, road conditions)
- \( \delta \) is the **DiD coefficient**, measuring the effect of the ABV increase on fatalities.
